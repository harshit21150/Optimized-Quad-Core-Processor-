# Optimized Quad Core Processor with Directory-Based Cache Coherency Protocol

This project focuses on the development of an optimized version of a Quad Core Processor utilizing a Directory-Based Cache Coherency Protocol. The processor is designed with multiple interconnect Bus Pipelines and L1 Cache memory access to each core via cache interconnect. A unique Instruction Set Semantic is employed to provide internal connection between System Memory and Core pipeline.

## Overview

The optimized Quad Core Processor aims to enhance performance and efficiency through the integration of advanced cache coherence techniques and efficient interconnect architecture. The key components of this project include:

- **Directory-Based Cache Coherency Protocol**: Ensures cache coherence among multiple cores by maintaining a directory that tracks the ownership and sharing status of cache lines.

- **Interconnect Bus Pipelines**: Multiple interconnect bus pipelines facilitate efficient communication between cores and memory, minimizing latency and improving throughput.

- **L1 Cache Memory Access**: Each core is equipped with L1 cache memory access, enabling faster data retrieval and reducing the need for accessing the main memory.

- **Unique Instruction Set Semantic**: Utilizes a unique instruction set semantic to establish internal connections between the System Memory and Core pipeline, optimizing data flow and processing efficiency.
